## Introduction
This project aims to detect brain tumors from MRI images using deep learning techniques. The goal is to provide a reliable, automated tool for early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of MRI images labeled with the presence or absence of a brain tumor. You can download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). Ensure to place the dataset in the appropriate directory before running the code.

## Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siba1010/Brain_Tumor_Detection.git
   cd Brain_Tumor_Detection

2.Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
 # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   
3.Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
